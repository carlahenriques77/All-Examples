let emptiness // Undefined, it seems. Weird. It feels like as if he's teaching some very useless stuff...

console.log(emptiness, emptiness + 3, `o valor é ${emptiness}`) // NaN again and Undefined. It won't work if nothing has been added to it...

let emptiness01 = null // Null. It's different from Underfined, somehow... Anyway, some things still work with it, odd enough. I can't quite picture a situation where I would need to use it... Though, he says that it has some.

console.log(emptiness01, emptiness01 + 3, `o valor é ${emptiness01}`)
