                <h2>Wolf</h2>
                <p>
                  The wolf (Canis lupus: wolves), also known as the gray wolf or
                  grey wolf, is a large canine native to Eurasia and North
                  America.
                </p>
                <p>
                  More than thirty subspecies of Canis lupus have been
                  recognized, and gray wolves, as popularly understood, comprise
                  wild subspecies. The wolf is the largest extant member of the
                  family Canidae.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is also distinguished from other Canis species by its less
                  pointed ears and muzzle, as well as a shorter torso and a
                  longer tail. The wolf is nonetheless related closely enough to
                  smaller Canis species, such as the coyote and the golden
                  jackal, to produce fertile hybrids with them. The banded fur
                  of a wolf is usually mottled white, brown, gray, and black,
                  although subspecies in the arctic region may be nearly all
                  white.

                <h2>Squirrel</h2>
                <p>
                  Squirrels are members of the family Sciuridae, a family that
                  includes small or medium-size rodents.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The squirrel family includes tree squirrels, ground squirrels
                  (including chipmunks and prairie dogs, among others), and
                  flying squirrels. Squirrels are indigenous to the Americas,
                  Eurasia, and Africa, and were introduced by humans to
                  Australia.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The earliest known fossilized squirrels date from the Eocene
                  epoch, and among other living rodent families, the squirrels
                  are most closely related to the mountain beaver and to the
                  dormice.

                <h2>Bear</h2>
                <p>Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae.</p>
                <p>
                  They are classified as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans.
                  Although only eight species of bears are extant, they are
                  widespread, appearing in a wide variety of habitats throughout
                  the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern
                  Hemisphere. Bears are found on the continents of North
                  America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Common
                  characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with
                  stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair,
                  plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and short
                  tails.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Bears have been hunted since prehistoric times for their meat
                  and fur; they have been used for bear-baiting and other forms
                  of entertainment, such as being made to dance. With their
                  powerful physical presence, they play a prominent role in the
                  arts, mythology, and other cultural aspects of various human
                  societies. In modern times, bears have come under pressure
                  through encroachment on their habitats and illegal trade in
                  bear parts, including the Asian bile bear market. The poaching
                  and international trade of these most threatened populations
                  are prohibited, but still ongoing.

                <h2>Fox</h2>
                <p>
                  Foxes are small to medium-sized, omnivorous mammals belonging
                  to several genera of the family Canidae. They have a flattened
                  skull, upright, triangular ears, a pointed, slightly upturned
                  snout, and a long bushy tail (or brush).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Twelve species belong to the monophyletic "true foxes" group
                  of genus Vulpes. Approximately another 25 current or extinct
                  species are always or sometimes called foxes; these foxes are
                  either part of the paraphyletic group of the South American
                  foxes, or of the outlying group, which consists of the
                  bat-eared fox, gray fox, and island fox.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Foxes live on every continent except Antarctica. The most
                  common and widespread species of fox is the red fox (Vulpes
                  vulpes) with about 47 recognized subspecies.[2] The global
                  distribution of foxes, together with their widespread
                  reputation for cunning, has contributed to their prominence in
                  popular culture and folklore in many societies around the
                  world. The hunting of foxes with packs of hounds, long an
                  established pursuit in Europe, especially in the British
                  Isles, was exported by European settlers to various parts of
                  the New World.

                <h2>Lion</h2>
                <p>
                  The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera
                  native to Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested
                  body; short, rounded head; round ears; and a hairy tuft at the
                  end of its tail.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than
                  females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species,
                  forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few
                  adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions
                  usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The
                  lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions
                  scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt
                  humans, lions typically do not actively seek out and prey on
                  humans.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The lion inhabits grasslands, savannas and shrublands. It is
                  usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but when
                  persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at
                  twilight. During the Neolithic period, the lion ranged
                  throughout Africa and Eurasia from Southeast Europe to India,
                  but it has been reduced to fragmented populations in
                  sub-Saharan Africa and one population in western India.

                <h2>Mandrill</h2>
                <p>
                  The mandrill (Mandrillus sphinx) is a large Old World monkey
                  native to west central Africa. It is one of the most colorful
                  mammals in the world, with red and blue skin on its face and
                  posterior.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The species is sexually dimorphic, as males have a larger
                  body, longer canine teeth and brighter coloring. Its closest
                  living relative is the drill with which it shares the genus
                  Mandrillus. Both species were traditionally thought to be
                  baboons, but further evidence has shown that they are more
                  closely related to white-eyelid mangabeys.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Mandrills mainly live in tropical rainforests but will also
                  travel across savannas. They are active during the day and
                  spend most of their time on the ground. Their preferred foods
                  are fruit and seeds, but mandrills will consume leaves, piths,
                  mushrooms, and animals from insects to juvenile antelope.
                  Mandrills live in large, stable groups known as "hordes" which
                  can number in the hundreds. Females form the core of these
                  groups, while adult males are solitary and only reunite with
                  the larger groups during the breeding season. Dominant males
                  have the most vibrant colors and fattest flanks and rumps, and
                  have the most success siring young.
