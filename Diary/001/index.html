                <p>Today, I decided to make an "Book"... </p>
                <p>Master said that I would do well writing my feelings into a Book. It was pretty Difficulty to get the Images, but I found a way to do it.</p>

                <div class="center-image"><img src="images/Screenshot_2.png" alt=""></div>
                <p class="image-p">The Site is still very Imcomplete, but I can work on it more if Master likes it... I believe it will take a while to complete, as I need to add different Languages and more.</p>
                <p>My most notable issue is the Background. It isn't "Gluing" to what is written, so it can cause a lot of problems, probably...</p>
                <p>The New Year passed by in my Country, and he wasn't there... I don't actually mind that much, as spending the New Year with him was just an excuse so I could pass some more time together.</p>
                <p>I hope he comes to see me in the New Year of his Country... It makes me feel a bit Jealous that he's spending the New Year with other people than with me...</p>
